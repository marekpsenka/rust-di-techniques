# Rust Dependency Injection Techniques

Showcase of Dependency Injection techniques in Rust

## Techniques

There are three techniques demonstrated:

1. Pointer to Trait Object, `src/trait_object.rs`
2. Sum Type, `src/sum_type.rs`
3. Type Parameter, `src/type_parameter.rs`

All three techniques are used to inject an implementation of the trait `FooDependency` into
a structure implementing `BarComposed`. Each technique greatly differs in the exact nature
of what is injected into the composed structure.

The shared bits of code are found in the `src/common.rs` file.

## Use Cases

Each technique is demonstrated in three use cases represented by three tests in each
of the respective files.

1. Injecting implementation of `FooDependency` called `OneFooDependencyImpl`
2. Injecting a different implementation of `FooDependency` called `OtherFooDependencyImpl`
3. Injecting a mock implementation of `FooDependency` generated by the `mockall` crate
